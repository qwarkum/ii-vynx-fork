/**
 * The shell behaving as though a pen, rather than a mouse, is the pointer.
 *
 * Two things change, and they are separable because people want them separately.
 *
 * **The pointer becomes a pen.** Not by shipping cursor artwork — that would clash with
 * whatever theme the user picked, and Hyprland's `setcursor` selects a theme rather than
 * a shape anyway — but by deriving a theme from theirs that inherits everything and
 * overrides only the arrow with that same theme's own `pencil`. The pen cursor is the
 * user's own cursor art. See scripts/tablet/pen-cursor.sh.
 *
 * **The barrel buttons do shell things.** This is the OpenTabletDriver question, and the
 * answer turned out to be that no OpenTabletDriver integration is needed: OTD passes the
 * barrel buttons through as ordinary `BTN_STYLUS` / `BTN_STYLUS2` on the tablet device,
 * so the daemon that already watches that device for the keyboard's sake can report them.
 * The alternative — writing key combinations into OTD's settings.json and binding those
 * combinations in Hyprland — would need the user to keep three files in agreement, and
 * would break the moment they opened OTD's own UI. This needs nothing configured
 * anywhere but here.
