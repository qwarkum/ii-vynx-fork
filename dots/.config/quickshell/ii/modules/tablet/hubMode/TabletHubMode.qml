/**
 * What the tablet becomes when it is charging and nobody is using it.
 *
 * The Pixel Tablet's defining trick is that docking it stops it being a tablet: it turns
 * into a photo frame and a smart display, useful from across the room. That is the one
 * feature of the reference product this family had no answer to at all — plugged in and
 * idle, it just sat on the home screen at full brightness.
 *
 * The trigger is charging plus idle, because "docked" is not something this shell can know.
 * A charging cable is the closest honest proxy: it is the state where the device is parked
 * somewhere rather than in your hands, and it is also the state where an always-on screen
 * costs nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately not the OLED saver, which blanks the screen. This is the opposite request —
 * the screen stays on and shows something worth looking at — so the two are separate
 * surfaces, and Hub Mode stands down whenever the saver is up on that monitor rather than
 * fighting it for the same output.
