/**
 * Draw on the screen, over whatever is on it.
 *
 * The surface has three states, and the difference between them is the whole feature:
 *
 *   drawing  — the layer takes every touch, so a stroke goes to the ink and not to the
 *              browser underneath. The tray is up and the pencil is lit.
 *   kept     — the ink is still there and still on top, the tray is still up, and the
 *              layer takes nothing but the tray: taps go straight through to the
 *              applications. One tap on the pencil goes back to drawing.
 *   closed   — no tray at all, and the ink still on its workspace until it is rubbed out.
 *
 * A sheet belongs to the workspace it was drawn on, so switching away takes the drawing
 * with it and switching back brings it out again — which is what makes it an annotation
 * of that screen rather than a drawing that follows you around.
