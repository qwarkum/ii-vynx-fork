 * The ink, and which home screen each sheet of it belongs to.
 *
 * A drawing here is not a document — it is a note stuck to a workspace. You draw on top
 * of whatever is there, and it stays over that workspace until you rub it out or save
 * it, the way a sticky note stays on the monitor it was stuck to. So the store is keyed
 * by workspace, and the surface that draws it shows the sheet for the workspace in
 * front and nothing else.
 *
 * Deliberately in memory only. A workspace annotation that outlived a reboot would be a
 * surprise — you would come back to a machine with drawings on it and no memory of
 * making them — and the ink that is meant to last has a button that puts it in Notes.
