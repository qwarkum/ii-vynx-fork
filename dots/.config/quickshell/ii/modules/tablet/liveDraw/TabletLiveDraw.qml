/**
 * Draw on the screen with a pen, and keep it or file it.
 *
 * The reference is what a Galaxy Tab does when the stylus comes out: the screen becomes
 * something you can write on, over whatever was already there. Here the sheet belongs to
 * the workspace it was drawn on and stays there — over the applications, out of their
 * way — until it is rubbed out or saved into Notes.
 *
 * One surface per screen, loaded only while there is a reason: drawing mode, or ink on a
 * sheet somewhere. An always-mapped Overlay layer per monitor is a surface the
 * compositor composites forever for nothing.
