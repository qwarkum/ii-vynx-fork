/**
 * What Edit Mode may not draw on: the edges the bar and the dock occupy.
 *
 * Both stay where they are, at full size, while the mode is on (editing them
 * in place is stage 6), so the desktop shrinks inside what is LEFT of the
 * screen and the toolbar sits in a band opened inside that. Three windows
 * derive the viewport from these four numbers - the wallpaper surface, the
 * widgets surface and the chrome - and a second file working them out would be
 * a second answer to "where is the dock".
 *
 * The bar's inset is its BODY, derived from configuration: the bar's layer
 * surface carries a hover strip and shadow padding several times the bar's
 * height (194 px for a 40 px bar on the machine this was measured on), so the
 * surface is the wrong number. The dock's inset is published by the dock
 * window itself (`GlobalStates.dockInsets`) from the one thickness it reveals
 * at rest - the dock is the only place that knows its padding and style.
 *
 * The reservation is a function of configuration only, never of auto-hide,
 * hover reveal or `barOpen`: those move while the mode is on, and a viewport
 * that changes size mid-edit rescales every widget under the cursor. The
 * mode holds both panels visible for exactly that reason.
