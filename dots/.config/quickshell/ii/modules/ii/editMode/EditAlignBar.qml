/**
 * The selection's own toolbar: align and distribute, over whatever is picked.
 *
 * It appears only for two or more widgets, because that is the fewest a line
 * can be made of, and its distribute half needs three - the two ends of a
 * distribution are held where they are, so with nothing between them there is
 * nothing to place. Rather than hiding those two, they disable: a control that
 * comes and goes moves every other control on the row with it, and the row is
 * centred on the selection, so the whole thing would slide under the pointer
 * as a third widget is picked.
 *
 * Drawn on the widgets surface rather than on the chrome's, unlike the widget
 * menu. The menu is summoned at a pointer that can be anywhere, including over
 * the bar; this belongs to a rectangle that is always inside the card, which
 * the bar and the dock are inset away from by construction. Staying on the
 * canvas means it shares the widgets' coordinate space and follows a group
 * drag with no mapping at all - it only has to undo the mode's shrink, which
 * is one number.
