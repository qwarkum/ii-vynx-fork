/**
 * Dot power button.
 *
 * A control you use once a day should not hold a permanent glyph's worth of
 * weight in the bar. At rest this is a dot; the symbol only appears when you go
 * for it, and stays while the session screen is up.
 *
 *   rest   a small dot in the bar's own ink
 *   hover  the dot opens out into the power symbol
 *   open   the symbol stays, in the accent
 *
 * The hit area never changes — only the drawing inside it does — so the button
 * is exactly as easy to click as the other two, and the bar cannot reflow when
 * the pointer crosses it.
