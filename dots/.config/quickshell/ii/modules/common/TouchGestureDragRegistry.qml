/**
 * Where a panel family claims an edge gesture as a *continuous drag* instead of a
 * discrete action.
 *
 * TouchGestureActionRegistry handles the normal case: the finger travels far enough,
 * the gesture commits, one action fires. Some surfaces instead need the whole drag —
 * the tablet shade follows the finger down the screen and settles from the release
 * velocity, so it has to see every move event, not just the commit.
 *
 * The service used to import the tablet module directly and test
 * `Config.options.panelFamily === "tablet"` inline, which made a shared service depend
 * on one family's implementation: adding a second dragging family meant editing the
 * service, and the tablet module could never be deleted without breaking it. The
 * dependency is inverted here. The service only ever talks to this registry; a family
 * registers its handlers from its own composition root and takes them away when it
 * unloads.
 *
 * A handler is any object providing:
 *
 *     function claims(origin): bool          // "topEdge", "leftEdge", "rightEdge", "bottomEdge"
 *     function actionId(origin): string      // optional; names the drag for the feedback overlay
 *     function begin(origin, screenName)
 *     function update(origin, screenName, travel, velocity, dx, dy)
 *     function release(origin, velocity)     // the drag is over; settle it
 *     function cancel(origin)
 *
 * `travel` is the raw primary-axis distance in pixels. Mapping it to a 0..1 progress is
 * the handler's business — only it knows what a full open means for its own surface.
 *
 * The origins are the four edges, the four corners, and "surface" for the body of the
 * screen. A surface drag has no axis, so `travel` is the distance along whichever axis is
 * longer and `dx`/`dy` carry the direction; edge handlers can ignore both. Nothing arms a
 * surface drag unless a handler claims it, so a family that does not is unaffected.
 *
 * Several handlers may be registered at once, each claiming different edges: a home
 * screen wants the bottom edge for its app drawer while the shade holds the top. Two
 * handlers claiming the SAME edge is a bug in the family, not a supported layering —
 * the first one registered wins and the collision is logged, because silently picking
 * one would make the loser's surface simply never respond.
